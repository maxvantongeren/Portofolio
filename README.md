 In this repository I will be covering a corpus conisting of the most popular songs throught the years. This way I can look for patterns and techniques that can explain why certain songs have become so popular. It will be interesting to see, if there are any differences between years and genres. Does an old popular song like 'Stairway to heaven' by Led Zeppelin have musical similairities with a more recent popular song like 'Shape of You' by Ed Sheeran.
